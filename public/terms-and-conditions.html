        services' specific terms outlined in the Legal Center.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for obtaining and paying for any equipment and Internet service necessary to access the
        Services. We may alter, suspend, or discontinue the Studytomy Platform or the Services in whole or in part, at

        to maintenance or malfunction of computer equipment or other reasons. We may provide access to third party
        services and products from time to time or to our own products or Services. You acknowledge that the Studytomy
        Platform is evolving and that the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without notice to
        you.</p>

    <p>Services are available only to and may only be used by individuals who are 18 years and older and who can form
        legally binding contracts under applicable law. Individuals under the age of 18 but not younger than the age of
        13 can use our Services only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or a legal guardian. The
        parent or the legal guardian shall at all times be responsible for any and all activities related to the use of

    <p>You agree and confirm that you will not allow any individual younger than the age of 13 to use the Services.</p>

    <h3>2.2. Verification</h3>

    <p>Studytomy may request a Tutor to provide a government-issued ID (passport, driver’s license, etc.) and the
        documents confirming the claimed educational credentials (educational background documents, such as diplomas,
        certificates, etc.). The Tutor will be asked to upload a copy of the Tutor’s government-issued ID and their
        educational document(s). As a Tutor passes the verification procedure, a special badge is added to the Tutor’s
        profile, and the uploaded copies of the documents get deleted from our servers.</p>

    <p>Studytomy does not endorse or make any representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, and
        reliability of any information provided by the Tutor within the verification procedure.</p>

    <p>Studytomy cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be. You agree and understand that you assume all
        risks when using the Services, including without limitation any and all of the risks associated with any online
        or offline interactions with other Users.</p>

    <p>When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety
        and property, just as you would when interacting with other people you don’t know. Neither Studytomy nor its

        Studytomy, its affiliates, and licensors will not be liable for any claim, injury, or damage arising from or in
        connection with your use of the Services.</p>

    <h3>2.3. Consumer Reports</h3>

    <p>Studytomy may or may not utilize third-party consumer reporting agencies that perform, among other things,
        criminal background checks, sex offender registry checks, motor vehicle records checks, credit checks, and
        identification verifications (“Consumer reports”). Studytomy does not endorse or make any representations or
        warranties regarding the reliability of such Consumer reports or the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of
        any information in the Consumer reports. Studytomy does not independently verify information in the Consumer
        reports.</p>

    <p>You hereby consent to Studytomy collecting, using, and disclosing the information in the Consumer reports. You
        understand and agree that Studytomy may, in its sole discretion, review and rely on the information in the
        Consumer reports in deciding whether to suspend or terminate a User account or to investigate a complaint about
        a User, but that Studytomy shall not be responsible or liable in any way in the event that any information in
        the Consumer reports about any person, including without limitation any User, is not accurate, timely or
        complete. Users who are the subject of Consumer reports may contact the third-party consumer reporting agency to
        dispute such information's accuracy, timeliness, or completeness. Studytomy reserves the right to suspend and/or
        terminate a User account based on the information in the Consumer reports or for any other reason at Studytomy's
        sole discretion.</p>

        providing the tools to facilitate the tutoring services. You acknowledge and agree that Studytomy is a
        technology services provider that does not provide online tutoring services or functions as a language learning
        school.</p>

    <p>Studytomy does not serve as an employer of any User unless separately subject to a signed, written employment
        contract signed by both the User and Studytomy. Users may use the Services only for the provision and receipt of
        the tutoring services subject to these Terms.</p>

    <p>As such, Studytomy will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment
        insurance, employer’s liability, workers’ compensation insurance, social security, or payroll withholding tax in
        connection with your use of Services. You are solely responsible for adhering to all applicable tax regulations
        that may apply in connection with your use of the Services. You hereby agree to compensate Studytomy for all
        state fees, claims, payments, fines, or other tax liabilities that Studytomy will incur in connection with the
        obligations arising from applicable tax or other regulations not being met by you.</p>

        or benefit plans offered by Studytomy to its employees.</p>

    <p>The Services provide connection to Tutors who are willing to be engaged by Students as independent contractors.
        As independent contractors, each Tutor decides when and how often the Tutor will be available to provide the
        tutoring services to Students. Each Tutor controls the methods, materials, content, and all aspects of the
        tutoring services. The Services allow Tutors to create subject-specific tutoring services, for a certain number
        of hours.</p>

    <p>Students are responsible for selecting the Tutor suitable for their learning goals. Students should check each
        Tutor's self-reported credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from other Students. Each Tutor
        has the sole discretion to accept or decline a request for the tutoring services, as well as continue or
        discontinue a tutoring relationship with any Student.</p>

    <p>Tutors may and, in fact are expected to perform the tutoring services for others or do other types of work
        (either as an independent contractor or employee or other) while these Terms are in effect, including with
        Studytomy’s competitors if desired, provided that such other activities do not result in the Tutor’s violation
        of the Terms.</p>
